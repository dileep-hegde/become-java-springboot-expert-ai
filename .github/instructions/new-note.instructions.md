# Topic Note Writing Guidelines

## File Naming & Placement

- **Filename**: kebab-case matching the note `id`: `thread-lifecycle.md`, `spring-bean-scopes.md`
- **Location**: `docs/<domain-path>/` — use `java/<domain>` for Java language/JVM topics and `spring-boot`, `web`, etc. for top-level domains
- **No stubs**: Every published note must be complete — no placeholder or TODO sections

---

## Required Frontmatter

Every note must begin with this YAML block:

```yaml
---
id: unique-kebab-case-id         # Must match filename (without .md)
title: Human-Readable Title
description: One sentence for search results and the overview page.
sidebar_position: <integer>      # Determines sort order within the domain
tags:
  - java                         # Always include the platform tag
  - spring-boot                  # Framework tag, if applicable
  - beginner                     # EXACTLY ONE: beginner | intermediate | advanced
  - concept                      # EXACTLY ONE: concept | tool | pattern | config
  - threads                      # 2–4 specific topic tags (kebab-case)
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD         # Today's date
sources:
  - https://...                  # At least one authoritative source URL
---
```

### Allowed Tag Values

**Platform** (include all that apply):
`java`, `spring-boot`, `spring-framework`, `spring-security`, `spring-data`, `spring-web`, `kafka`, `docker`, `kubernetes`, `maven`, `gradle`, `jvm`

**Difficulty** — pick **exactly one**:
`beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced`

**Note type** — pick **exactly one**:
`concept`, `tool`, `pattern`, `config`

**Topic tags**: Use existing tags before inventing new ones. Keep them lowercase and kebab-case.

### `sidebar_position` Rule

Check existing files in the domain folder. Assign the next available integer. Foundational notes get lower numbers (1–5); advanced notes get higher.

## Mandatory Sections (in this exact order)

```
1.  # Title
2.  > One-sentence blockquote tagline
3.  ## What Problem Does It Solve?
4.  ## What Is It?            ← or use the concept name as the heading (see Flexibility Rules)
5.  ## How It Works
6.  ## Code Examples
7.  ## Best Practices         ← or Trade-offs & When To Use / Avoid (see Flexibility Rules)
8.  ## Common Pitfalls
9.  ## Interview Questions
10. ## Further Reading
11. ## Related Notes          (if cross-links add value)
```

**Minimum 5–7 sections, maximum 10–12 total.** Do not skip mandatory sections; write a brief note if content is thin rather than omitting the heading.

### Section Flexibility Rules

The template is a **starting point**, not a rigid cage. Apply these rules when a section name or its presence would make the note unnatural or repetitive:

#### Rule 1 — Rename "What Is It?" to the concept name
If the topic is a concrete, well-named thing (a class, annotation, or mechanism), use the concept name as the heading instead of the generic question form:

```markdown
## Thread                         ← instead of "## What Is It?"
A thread is the smallest unit of execution in the JVM...
```

```markdown
## @Transactional                 ← instead of "## What Is It?"
Spring's declarative transaction boundary annotation...
```

Use the question form (`## What Is It?`) only when the concept is abstract or needs framing first (e.g., "What Is Dependency Injection?").

#### Rule 2 — Swap "Best Practices" for "Trade-offs & When To Use / Avoid"
For tools, patterns, and features with meaningful downsides, replace `## Best Practices` with:

```markdown
## Trade-offs & When To Use / Avoid
| | Pros | Cons |
|--|------|------|
```

For concepts with actionable dos and don'ts, keep `## Best Practices`.

#### Rule 3 — Add topically necessary sections
The following optional sections may be added *between* sections 6 and 9 when genuinely useful. Do not exceed 12 total sections:

| Section | When to add |
|---------|-------------|
| `## Analogy` | Abstract concepts that need a real-world bridge |
| `## Real-World Use Cases` | When production context meaningfully clarifies the concept |
| `## Comparison` | Concept best understood against a similar alternative |
| `## Internals` | JVM or Spring internals that explain observable behavior |
| `## Use Cases` | When listing practical scenarios helps more than prose |

#### Rule 4 — Skip optional sections that add no value
If a section would be a stub or repeat earlier content, omit it rather than leaving it empty. The minimum is 5 complete sections.

## Per-Section Content Rules

### `## What Problem Does It Solve?`

**This is the most important section — never skip or write only one line.**

- Describe the concrete pain point that existed *before* this concept/tool
- 2–4 sentences of prose; start from the developer's perspective and frustration
- No buzzwords — be specific about what breaks without this feature

### `## What Is It?`

- Clear definition in plain language
- If an analogy helps, add an `## Analogy` subsection immediately after or inline
- Do not define by negation only ("it's not like X") — say what it *is*

### `## How It Works`

- Include at least one Mermaid diagram for flow or architecture concepts
- Number the steps for multi-step processes
- Use admonitions for key callouts:
  - `:::tip` — best practice shortcut
  - `:::warning` — common mistake
  - `:::info` — background context that isn't critical to the flow
  - `:::danger` — destructive, irreversible, or security-sensitive behavior

### `## Code Examples`

- Fenced blocks with correct language identifiers: ` ```java `, ` ```yaml `, ` ```bash `, ` ```xml `
- Annotate every non-obvious line: `repo.save(user); // ← triggers @PrePersist lifecycle hook`
- Show the minimal Spring Boot setup needed to run each snippet (just the annotation + bean if needed)
- Keep examples self-contained and runnable where possible
- Prefer realistic examples that a developer would write in production over toy/contrived examples

### `## Interview Questions`

Group by difficulty with subheadings — always include all three levels:

```markdown
### Beginner

**Q:** What is X?
**A:** X is... (1–2 clear sentences)

### Intermediate

**Q:** How does X differ from Y?
**A:** ...

### Advanced

**Q:** How does X interact with Z under concurrent load?
**A:** ...

**Follow-up:** ...
**A:** ...
```

Answers must be sayable verbally in 1–2 minutes.

### `## Further Reading`

Format every link as:
```markdown
- [Title](URL) — one-line description of what's useful in this specific link
```

Include at least one link from the priority source list.

### `## Related Notes`

Format:
```markdown
- [Note Title](../domain/note-id.md) — explain *why* this note is related, not just that it is
```

---

## Source Priority for `sources:` Frontmatter

1. https://dev.java — official Java documentation
2. https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference — Spring Framework
3. https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/ — Spring Boot
4. https://www.baeldung.com — practical Spring/Java guides
5. https://docs.telusko.com/docs/java — only if cross-verified with one of the above

---

## Cross-Linking Rules

- Every note must link to at least 2–3 related notes
- Use Docusaurus relative paths: `[link text](../domain/note-id.md)`
- Links in body copy are fine; consolidate in `## Related Notes` at the bottom
- Explain *why* topics are related, not just that they are

### Foundational Concept Linking

When a note uses a term or concept that is covered by a simpler, foundational note:
- **Inline-link the first occurrence** of that term in the body text back to the foundational note
- Only link the *most essential* foundational term — do not turn every technical word into a link
- The purpose is navigation: if a reader doesn't know the linked term, they can click through to build context before continuing

**Example pattern:**
```markdown
A [Thread](../multithreading/threads.md) is the fundamental unit of concurrency in Java.
Multithreading allows many threads to run concurrently, sharing the same JVM memory.
```

**Rules:**
- Link on first mention only — do not repeat the same link in the same note
- Choose the single most unfamiliar prerequisite term per paragraph or per section
- The foundational note *must already exist* — do not create a broken link to a planned note
- If the foundational note is in a different domain, use a cross-domain relative path: `../../other-domain/note-id.md`

---

## Style Rules

- **Prose + bullets + code** is the correct mix — not pure bullet dumps
- Plain, direct language — no academic prose or unnecessary jargon
- Analogies are strongly encouraged for abstract concepts
- Do NOT use deprecated APIs without explicitly labeling: `**Legacy** (pre-Java 17 / pre-Spring Boot 3)`
- Do NOT invent API behavior — if uncertain, say so and cite a source
- Do NOT add a `sidebar_position` that conflicts with existing files in the domain
